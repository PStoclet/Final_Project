                <p>Kylian Mbappe is in a difficult situation. He has been less effective for a year now. These are the views of Didier Deschamps himself during a relaxed interview in which he spoke with Lizarazu for TF1 about the problems that today's players have to face compared to those of his time: the calendar, social networks and pressure affect the physical and also the mental. Although at that time the talk was more generic, when it came to Mbappe, the coach, who is not comfortable talking about the reasons for the discard, also got wet about the fact that Kylian is playing as a 9 in his club and in the national team and this may harm him: "He has been less effective in 2024, but I see no reason to think that he will not return to his level. He is going through a difficult time, but he has everything to return. He can play in several positions and, although you are going to tell me that I'm crazy to put him as a center forward, with his last two coaches at his club (Luis Enrique and Ancelotti) he has played as a center forward as well."</p>

                <p>Few talents raised as much expectation as the Brazilians Vitor Roque (2005) and Endrick Felipe (2006) after making the leap to European football. They were said to be the faces of Real Madrid and Barcelona in the coming years, but the reality has turned out to be quite different. The former did not fit into Xavi's plans, who had not asked for his signing and ended up giving more minutes to the youth players, and the latter is suffering terribly to get minutes in Ancelotti's scheme in his first season with Los Blancos. 2024 was expected to be the starting signal to enjoy the first battle of a rivalry that should have been full of goals and talent. It was understood that they were going to go hand in hand throughout their careers, but the search for the throne of the number nine in Spanish football will have to wait. The 'hype' was so great that no one dared to put a ceiling on either of the two young talents: fast, strong, explosive and dribblers. They shared the same dream, different shirt, which now seems almost more like a nightmare.</p>

                <p>Jude Bellingham finally scored against Osasuna in what is proving to be a very different start to the season with Real Madrid compared to his first year in the white shirt, when he saw the goal with incredible, amazing ease. Now everything is different. The Englishman's performances have nothing to do with what he showed last year. He himself has stressed that the coach asks him for different things, that he has played further away from the goal and that his position has been different, so his options to reach the opponent's area have been limited.</p>

                <p>Real Madrid is shaking up the market. It is evident. The need of the white team in the face of the casualties it suffers due to injuries (three of its defenders suffer the rigors of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in one of their knees), acts as an alarm for players and agents to be activated in search of a destination. It all started with Carvajal's injury, but Militao's has set the machinery in motion for all kinds of offers. They say 100, it could be 200 if all the calls and recommendations received were heeded, but one of those moves has been different from all the others. We are talking about Sergio Ramos, who is waiting to find a destination while he continues to work hard, as we have seen.</p>
